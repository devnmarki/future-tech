A multi-page platform for AI-related blogs and podcasts. This is a portfolio project I built to master the fundamentals of **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📖 Overview
**Future Tech** is designed for people who want to stay updated on AI trends. My goal was to create a fast, "dark-mode first" experience that handles different types of content seamlessly.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* **React + Vite**: For a lightning-fast development environment.
* **TypeScript**: To ensure my data (blog posts/podcasts) is structured and bug-free.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For custom styling without the overhead of massive CSS files.
* **React Router**: To handle navigation across multiple pages without reloading the browser.
